# dart_screeps

A library that provides Dart bindings for the JavaScript Screeps API.

Note: this library is currently a work-in-progress and drastic changes to the API may be made.

## Usage

Much of this library attempts to stay true to the original API.  However, it also attempts to make the development experience more enjoyable by introducing handy methods.

In particular, a few methods from Room and RoomPosition have either been consolidated into one.

This library also tries to proide in-code documentation for all facets of the API to minimize the amount of docs-referencing necessary.
